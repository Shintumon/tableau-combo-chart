# Privacy Policy for Combo Chart Extension

**Effective Date:** February 11, 2026
**Last Updated:** February 11, 2026

## Overview

The Combo Chart Extension ("the Extension") is a free, open-source Tableau Viz Extension developed by Shintumon. This privacy policy describes how the Extension handles data.

## Data Collection and Usage

### No Data Collection
The Combo Chart Extension **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or analytics**. The Extension operates entirely within your Tableau environment and processes data only to render visualizations.

### Data Processing
- **Local Processing Only:** All data processing occurs within your Tableau worksheet. The Extension accesses data from the fields you add to the Marks card encodings solely for the purpose of rendering the combo chart visualization.
- **No External Transmission:** No data from your Tableau workbooks is sent to external servers, third-party services, or the extension developer.
- **No Cookies or Tracking:** The Extension does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any other tracking technologies.

### Configuration Settings
- Settings and customizations you apply to the chart (colors, labels, formatting) are stored locally in your Tableau workbook using Tableau's settings API.
- These settings are saved as part of your Tableau workbook file and remain under your control.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension is hosted on Cloudflare Pages for delivery. When you load the Extension in Tableau:
- Tableau fetches the extension files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from `https://tableau-combo-chart.pages.dev`
- This is a standard file delivery process and does not involve data transmission from your workbooks
- Cloudflare may log standard web server information (IP addresses, timestamps) as part of their hosting service. Please refer to [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for details on their data practices.

## Data Security

Since the Extension does not collect or transmit data, there are no data security concerns beyond those inherent to your Tableau environment. You should follow your organization's security policies for Tableau usage.

## Open Source

The Extension is open source and available on GitHub at [https://github.com/Shintumon/tableau-combo-chart](https://github.com/Shintumon/tableau-combo-chart). You can review the source code to verify our privacy practices.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect any information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. All data processing occurs locally within your Tableau environment, and you maintain full control over your data through Tableau's standard data management features.
